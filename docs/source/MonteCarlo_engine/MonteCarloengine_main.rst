Monte Carlo engine
=======================

By running thousands or even millions of simulations, Monte Carlo method can give the price
of complex financial instruments under varying conditions. Unlike other methods like finite
differences and decision trees, which may work well for particular types of assets or under
specific conditions, Monte Carlo allows for a great deal of flexibility. This ability to
generalize makes it an invaluable tool for financial analysts and traders who need to price
complex products in volatile markets.
