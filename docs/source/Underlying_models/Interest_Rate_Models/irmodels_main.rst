Interest rate models
=======================

Interest rate models are mathematical frameworks used to describe and analyze the behavior and dynamics of interest rates. 
These models help financial professionals, economists, and researchers understand and predict interest rate movements, which are crucial in pricing and managing interest rate products, valuing fixed income securities, and making informed investment decisions.
